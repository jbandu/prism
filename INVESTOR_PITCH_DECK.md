### Portfolio Risk Intelligence & Savings Management

**AI-Powered Enterprise SaaS Asset Management Platform**

*Helping enterprises eliminate SaaS waste, mitigate vendor risk, and optimize costs*

<!-- _class: lead -->

# **The Problem**

---

## 💸 The $100 Billion SaaS Waste Crisis

### Companies are bleeding money on software

- **Average enterprise**: 254 SaaS applications
- **30-40%** of SaaS spend is wasted
- **$18M annually** wasted per Fortune 500 company
- **67%** of companies have redundant tools
- **Ghost licenses**: 30% of paid seats unused

### Why does this happen?

❌ No centralized visibility into software portfolio
❌ Decentralized purchasing (shadow IT)
❌ Poor vendor risk assessment
❌ Missed renewal deadlines → auto-renewals at inflated prices
❌ Manual processes can't scale

## 📋 Appendix H: Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Key Risks

**1. Market Risk**: Competitors copy our AI features
- **Mitigation**: Patent-pending tech, 6-12 month lead, continuous innovation

**2. Technical Risk**: AI costs become prohibitive at scale
- **Mitigation**: Multi-provider architecture, 30-day caching, cost <$5/customer

**3. Sales Risk**: Long enterprise sales cycles
- **Mitigation**: Free pilots, clear ROI, self-serve tier for SMBs

**4. Regulatory Risk**: AI regulations (EU AI Act, etc.)
- **Mitigation**: Transparency, human-in-loop, compliance-first design

**5. Customer Concentration**: Over-reliance on large customers
- **Mitigation**: Target 1,000+ customers by Year 3 (no single customer >5% revenue)

**6. Talent Risk**: Difficulty hiring AI/ML engineers
- **Mitigation**: Remote-first, competitive equity, interesting technical challenges

**7. Funding Risk**: Unable to raise Series A
- **Mitigation**: Path to profitability by Year 3, strong unit economics
